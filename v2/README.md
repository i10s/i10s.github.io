# v2 Directory

Legacy HTML5 Boilerplate snapshot retained for historical/reference purposes.

These files (`doc/`, `css/`, `js/`, etc.) are **not** part of the active production homepage build. They remain to:

- Document upstream defaults used in an earlier iteration
- Provide examples of baseline HTML/CSS/JS patterns
- Serve as reference when adding or auditing new pages

## Guidelines

If you update anything here:

1. Prefer syncing with upstream HTML5 Boilerplate where practical.
2. Avoid inflating repository size—keep assets lean.
3. Do **not** duplicate active logic already implemented in root pages (`index.html`, `resume.html`, `now.html`).
4. Mark experimental changes clearly in commit messages (prefix with `v2:`).

## Modern Site Entry Points

- `index.html` (root) — current minimalist landing page
- `resume.html` — professional profile
- `now.html` — current focus

For new feature or doc work, modify root-level files instead of v2 unless explicitly exploring alternatives.

_Be clear. Stay lean. Ship small improvements._
