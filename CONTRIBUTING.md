# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest. This repository represents a personal static site—contributions are minimal by design. If you still wish to help:

## Types of Contributions
- Bug reports (broken links, typos)
- Security disclosures (via security.txt contact)
- Accessibility improvements

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch (`feat/improvement-name`).
3. Make changes (keep HTML/CSS lean). No frameworks.
4. Open a Pull Request with a concise description.

## Principles
- Keep size small (<10KB main page).
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA, semantic tags).
- Avoid adding external dependencies.
- Preserve performance optimizations.

## Local Development
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```
